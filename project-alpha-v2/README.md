# Project Alpha (Block 1): Multi-Page Static Website

This project is my first multi-page website built for **CIS-376 Web Development** at the University of North Alabama. The goal was to practice semantic HTML, responsive CSS (Grid/Flex), and a small bit of JavaScript, then deploy it with GitHub Pages.
